To achieve their goal of converting liability customers to personal loan customers, Thera Bank's management has decided to devise new marketing campaigns with better target marketing. This approach aims to increase the success ratio of the campaign while keeping the costs at a minimum.

In the past, the bank had already run a campaign for liability customers, which resulted in a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This positive outcome has encouraged the retail marketing department to explore more effective ways to target customers and increase the conversion rate.

To achieve this, the bank may consider leveraging data analytics and customer segmentation techniques to identify customer groups that are more likely to respond positively to the campaign. For example, the bank may use demographic, financial, and behavioral data to segment customers based on their income, age, education, spending habits, etc. This would enable the bank to create targeted campaigns that speak directly to the needs and interests of each customer segment, making the campaign more relevant and effective.

Furthermore, the bank may consider leveraging digital marketing channels such as email, social media, and targeted ads to reach customers where they spend most of their time. This would enable the bank to reach a wider audience at a lower cost and with more personalized messaging, further increasing the success ratio of the campaign.

Overall, the bank's focus on better target marketing, coupled with the use of data analytics and digital marketing channels, can help Thera Bank to achieve its goal of converting liability customers to personal loan customers, while retaining them as depositors.
